Amid rising demand for digital solutions, a website development company sought to **identify key factors 
influencing quarterly website delivery**. Data from 13 three-person teams, spanning January 2001 to August 
2002, included delivery counts and variables such as backlog, team experience, and a 2002 process change. 
This study examines how these factors—individually and interactively—affect productivity, using linear 
mixed-effects models with team-level random effects. The findings inform decisions on team structuring and 
operational improvements. 

The additive mixed-effects model, with BackGroup, ExpGroup, and ProcessChange as fixed effects and Team as a 
random intercept, was fitted using REML (criterion = 420.1). Residuals showed reasonable symmetry, and random 
effects indicated moderate between-team variability (variance = 3.35). **Only ProcessChange was statistically significant** 
(β = 9.15, p < 0.001), suggesting a strong positive impact on delivery after the 2002 redesign. BackGroup and ExpGroup 
were not significant, implying their effects may have been overshadowed by the process change. 

This analysis shows that **while backlog and experience were significant in earlier models, their effects diminished after 
accounting for the 2002 process change, which had a strong positive impact on delivery**. Due to data limitations, three
way interactions could not be interpreted. For future analysis, we recommend: (1) using a ProcessChange-only model 
if such data are available, or (2) using BackGroup and ExpGroup when intervention data are absent. Both approaches 
offer practical, interpretable insights based on data availability.
